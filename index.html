				Formed in 2013, The Airwaves have rapidly built a big reputation as a premium function band. 
				We provide the best mix of dance-floor gems from all eras for weddings, parties and events of all types. Whatever the function, wherever the party, The Airwaves deliver the perfect professional performance. Music from any era, suited to your requirements, played expertly and always with a smile.
				</p>
				<p>
				Hugely experienced musicians, the band is assembled from top local bands 
				such as The Motivators, Citizen Smith, 
				<a href="http://www.brotherhoodsroundabout.co.uk/" class="links-name">Brotherhood's Roundabout</a> and 
				<a href="http://www.retrolux.co.uk/" class="links-name">Retrolux</a>. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Playing all the best party songs from past decades and bringing it 
				bang up to date with recent chart material, The Airwaves cater
				for any occasion. 
				We provide a multitude of benefits, including:
				<li>Consummate professionalism</li>
				<li>A discreet but powerful quality P.A. and lighting system suitable for any venue</li>
				<li>An iPOD connection for your own background music or first dance that we'll play for you</li>
				<li>A selection of background music that we'll play for you; you can use this service as an alternative to booking a separate disco & D.J.</li>
				<li>We can set up in a small area and only require about an hour to install ourselves.</li>
				</p>
				<p>
				We'll do everything possible to make your special event a success, so anything that you need from a band, just ask
				and we'll do whatever it takes to achieve this. Learn a special song, no problem; set up at a specific time, let us know when; 
				play between this time and that time, we'll play when you're ready. 
				You'll also find us very competitively priced compared to other bands in the area - call to find out!
				</p>
				<p>
				For a minimal charge, we can also provide a pianist accompaniment to your event. Our very own keyboard player will 
				set up and play piano as background music during the function when required. Not only is it more convenient for you, 
				it is considerably less expensive than hiring a separate pianist.<br/>
				Please ask for more details.				
				</p>
				<p>
				Our equipment is PAT tested to ensure your safety and we have full Public Liability insurance.
